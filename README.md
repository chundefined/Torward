# Torward

Torward is an improved version based on the torghost-gn and darktor scripts, designed to enhance anonymity on the Internet. The tool prevents data leaks and forces all traffic from our computer to be routed exclusively through the Tor network, providing a high level of privacy in our connections.


## Installation

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chundefined/Torward.git
```

```bash
   cd Torward
```

```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
```

```bash
   ./install.sh
```

## TODO

- Get the IP from the last Tor exit node: Currently, the script does not display the IP of the last Tor exit node in the console. This can be achieved by using Tor's API to get the public IP of the exit node.
- Better error handling: Ensure that the tool properly handles errors, such as Tor disconnection or network issues.
